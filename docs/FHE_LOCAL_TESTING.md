# FHE / Confidential Matching — Local Testing (No AWS Node Required)

Last updated: 2026-04-02

You do **not** need to buy an AWS instance or a “node” to test FHE-style flows. You need a **process that runs cryptography** on your machine (or in free-tier Docker).

## Option A — Separate microservice (recommended for clarity)

1. Run a small HTTP service (Python or Rust) in **Docker on your PC** that:
   - exposes `POST /encrypt`, `POST /match` (or your chosen API)
   - uses a real HE library internally
2. Point Phantom backend at it with `FHE_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:PORT`.
3. Backend keeps the same routes; only the implementation behind them changes from mock to HTTP client.

**Pros:** language choice matches library (Python: Concrete / PySEAL; C++: OpenFHE). **Cons:** you maintain two processes.

## Option B — Native addon in Node (heavier)

Embed OpenFHE/SEAL via `node-gyp` or WASM build. **Pros:** one process. **Cons:** build pain on Windows; usually easier in Linux/WSL2 or Docker.

## Library choices (local dev)

| Library | Notes |
|--------|--------|
| **Zama Concrete** | Good for prototyping circuits; runs locally; docs for dev setup |
| **Microsoft SEAL** | Industry standard; BFV/CKKS; matching logic must be designed for supported ops |
| **OpenFHE** | Research-grade; C++ |

Full “order book on FHE” is hard: you start with a **narrow circuit** (e.g. compare two encrypted amounts with a fixed encoding, or sum checks) not a full DEX.

## What “workable testing” means (honest)

1. **Wire:** Phantom `/fhe/*` calls optional `FHE_SERVICE_URL`.
2. **Crypto:** Service returns real ciphertexts / real homomorphic op on toy parameters.
3. **Settlement:** On-chain settlement still uses your existing zk pool flow; FHE only helps **off-chain matching privacy** until you prove a full design.

## No TEE on laptop?

- **Intel SGX** is not on all CPUs; not required for FHE testing.
- **AWS Nitro Enclaves** is optional later for production TEE, not for first FHE tests.

## What is wired in this repo

1. **`FHE_SERVICE_URL`** (optional): when set, the relayer’s `/fhe` routes **`/match`**, **`/compute`**, **`/encrypt`**, and **`GET /public-key`** forward to that base URL (same paths on the remote).
2. **Unset:** existing deterministic mock stays the default.
3. **`GET /fhe/health`** reports `fheMode: "mock" | "remote"` and `fheServiceConfigured`.

## Verify the proxy without real FHE (stand-in)

From repo root (uses root `node_modules` / `ethers`):

```bash
node fhe-dev/standin-server.js
```

In another shell, start the relayer backend with:

```bash
set FHE_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9100
```

(or export on Unix). Hit `GET /fhe/health` on the relayer — you should see `fheMode: "remote"`. Order registration still uses the relayer order book; matching calls the stand-in’s `/match`.

## TenSEAL demo (real CKKS, local Docker)

Build and run (from repo root):

```bash
docker compose -f fhe-dev/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Service listens on **http://127.0.0.1:9101**. Point the relayer at it:

```bash
FHE_SERVICE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:9101
```

- **`/encrypt`** adds a **`_ckksAmount`** field (CKKS ciphertext hex) while preserving the JSON body for the dashboard.
- **`POST /compute`** with **`operation: "add"`** and **`encryptedInputs: [hex, hex]`** (two `_ckksAmount` values without `0x` or with) performs a **homomorphic add** on the server context.

This is **dev/demo** crypto (server holds the secret context), not production key custody.

## Next step toward production-shaped FHE

Move key generation toward a client or HSM, narrow the circuit, and keep the same HTTP contract so the relayer stays stable.
